    <h2>Delicious tuna melt recipe</h2>
        <p>This tuna melt recipe is dedicated to all those chefs who tell you to never, ever mix fish and cheese together; and yet there they are, at the diner at 2:00 in the morning. And you know what they eat? Tuna melts. And the reason they do is because they are delicious.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>1 (6.6 ounce) jar oil-packed tuna, drained</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons finely diced celery</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced green onion</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons capers, drained</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Asian chile pste (such as sambal oelek)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup fresh mozarella cheese</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons softened butter divided</li>
            <li>2 thick slices French bread</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place tuna into a mixing bowl and lightly break it apart with a fork. Add celery, green onion, capers, mayonnaise, and chile paste. Pinch in small pieces mozzarella and stir to mix. Season with salt and black pepper; refrigerate tuna salad until needed.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Spread butter generously on both sides of French bread slices.</li>
            <li>Broil buttered bread until golden brown on top, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip bread slices and broil other side until toasted, 2 to 3 more minutes. Remove from the oven and turn bread slices over on the baking sheet so the darkest sides are on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Gently spread tuna salad onto bread slices using 2 forks. Press the salad onto the bread and spread tuna all the way to the edges of the bread. Spread shredded Cheddar over each sandwich. Dust tops with cayenne pepper.</li>
            <li>Place sandwiches under the broiler and cook until cheese is melted and bubbling, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
